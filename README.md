## Note

☝️ This is not a true representation of most used languages, as I have over 30 private repositories in my personal Github account and over 50 private repositories spread across 3 personally owned organizations. These repositories use mixture of C++, BASH, SQL, Javascript (React and Node.js) and Python (for ML/AI)

## Sponsorship
If my work benefits you or your organization in any way, or you want to support me by resuming work on my dream project (Firewebkit Cloud Platform), please consider supporting me via [Github sponsorship program](https://github.com/sponsors/abumq).
